abstract={Crystallization of thin films of amorphous hydrogenated silicon under the irradiation of femtosecond laser pulses has been studied. It was found that the crystallization has a clearly pronounced threshold nature and depends on the laser emission wavelength. As shown the best results are achieved in crystallization at the laser wavelength range of 740–760 nm.},

abstract = {The luminescence spectrum of Radachlorin dissolved in water in the 600–1350nm spectral range excited by 405nm light has been recorded at the first time. The spectrum contains a wide band with peaks centered at 662, 715, 940, and 1274nm. Relative contributions to the spectrum from different sources have been evaluated. Ratio of the singlet oxygen signal to the total signal intensity averaged over the 1240–1300nm spectral range was determined to be 40%. Isolation of the singlet oxygen signal from the total signal at 1274nm has been achieved by means of a spectral-resolved TCSPC detection technique.},
